# Flask - Single Page Application

> This is a web application built using Flask micro-web-framework for server-side and HTML, CSS, JavaScript for client-side.

> The website is live at [lightpurp.herokuapp.com](https://lightpurp.herokuapp.com/)

# Features:
- The application's client-side routing is handled by AJAX for loading dynamic pages into the main page.
- once the website is loaded, the site will not be reloaded when navigating to different pages, hence providing a smooth and faster user experience.
